<pre>Appendix C: Multi-Wavelength Galaxy Illustrator (MGI) - User 
Manual 

<a id="introduction"></a>
Introduction 

The Multi-Wavelength Galaxy Illustrator (MGI) is a software framework that provides a set of 

tools for knowledge discovery and exploration of astronomical FITS (Flexible Image 

Transport System) files, with a particular focus on multi-wavelength visualisation of galaxies. 

MGI provides an interactive and immersive environment, supporting users in handling 

multi-wavelength astronomical datasets using both desktop and immersive platforms. 

While primarily designed for astronomical research, MGI's capabilities extend to other 

scientific disciplines, where similar data visualisation requirements exist. By leveraging game 

engine technologies and C# programming, the software enables intuitive manipulation and 

exploration of astronomical data. 

The three versions of MGI are: 

• MGI-Desktop: The MGI desktop version provides a fully interactive interface for users to 

visualise and explore FITS files. This version is ideal for those who want a user-friendly 

platform to access and manipulate multi-wavelength data in a 2D or 3D space.• MGI-VR: A 

virtual reality (VR) version for an immersive experience, allowing astronomers to explore 

galaxies in a 3D space. 

· MGI-VR: The VR version immerses users in a 3D galaxy environment using VR 

headsets such as the Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, or Valve Index. This version supports 

real-time interaction, where users can walk through galaxies and observe astronomical data 

with full immersion. 

<a id="vr-specs"></a>
VR Specifications: 

● A frame rate of at least 90Hz is required for smooth performance. 

● The prototype achieved a frame rate of 120Hz consistently, ensuring minimal latency 

and a smooth user experience. 

● Uses OpenXR, a universal API standard that bridges VR and AR platforms. 

• MGI-AR: An augmented reality (AR) version, developed at the University of Portsmouth, 

suitable for interactive educational and research applications. 



MGI was developed in collaboration with researchers at INAF - Italy.

Executable 

 

To install MGI-Desktop and MGI-VR, follow these steps: 

• Download the appropriate version from the official GitHub repository. 



 

• To start the software, double-click on the executable MGI-VR file 

• Launch MGI and load FITS files for exploration. 

The MGI-AR does not have the built version, as it is built specifically for the CCIXR lab at the 

University of Portsmouth. However, a basic visualiser has been created that can be adopted 

by other AR display screens. The link to the basic visualiser is at 

(https://github.com/osuhamuneni/BASIC-VISUALISER) 

For advanced users building from source: 

As a Unity-based virtual reality application, MGI-VR requires several setup steps to compile and 
run from source. Currently, due to VR hardware and driver limitations on Unix-based systems, 
MGI-VR is supported only on Windows. Support for other platforms will be evaluated as the VR 
ecosystem evolves. 

Prerequisites 

1. Install Unity 

• Download Unity Hub for Windows from the Unity website and install it. 

• Within Unity Hub, install Unity version 2021.3.xf1, where x is the latest available patch 
number in that series. 

• For development consistency, MGI-VR currently targets Unity 2021.3.xf1. Future version 
upgrades will be considered at major release milestones. 

2. Install CMake 

• Download and install CMake for Windows from https://cmake.org/download.

Use of the <a id="config-files"></a>
Configuration Files 

At the start of the MGI-VR a configuration screen is provide to give options to the user . The user 
can modify this file to customise the software to their needs. The configuration file 

has the following settings that can be modified: 

Colourisation Mode: Colouration is managed through the application of colour mapping or 

colour transfer functions, thereby enabling the customisation of chromatic attributes. 

Spatial Scaling of Galaxies: Spatial scaling of the galaxies within the scene world is 

mandated to ensure proportional representation. This can be achieved through either a 

uniform scaling parameter for simplicity or via utilising the Petrosian radius as a scaling 

metric. 

Cropping of Galaxies: Provide options for cropping out faint stars and celestial bodies at 

the outer edges of the galaxy. 

Denoising of Galaxies: Denoising of galaxies provides options to empower users to 

prototype specific visualisation types for galaxies, providing a means to determine the 

appearance of galaxies in the scene. 

6. <a id="testing"></a>
Testing and Deployment: 

o Run unit tests and validate output consistency. 

o Deploy the application for research or interactive use.
